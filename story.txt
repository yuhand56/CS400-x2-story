I have numerous homeworks due tomorrow and 3 exams next week, how about you my friend?

Grant: "I have 2 homework assignments due tomorrow and an exam in the morning. I also have 3 exams next week too."

Max: "I currently am drowning in my responsibilities with an exam tomorrow and next week along with multiple assignments I have yet to do. So im surviving."

Megan: "I'll just be happy if I don't flunk out."

And so it goes that college fucking sucks sometimes.
